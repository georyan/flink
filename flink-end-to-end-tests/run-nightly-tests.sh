# IMPORTANT:
# With the "skip_check_exceptions" flag one can disable default exceptions and errors checking in log files. This should be done
# carefully though. A valid reasons for doing so could be e.g killing TMs randomly as we cannot predict what exception could be thrown. Whenever
# those checks are disabled, one should take care that a proper checks are performed in the tests itself that ensure that the test finished
# in an expected state.
